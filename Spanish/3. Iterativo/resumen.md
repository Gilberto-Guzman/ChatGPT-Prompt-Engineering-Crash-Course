# Iterative Prompt Development

1. Idea
2. Implementation (code/data) prompt
3. Experimental result
4. Error Analysis

### Promp guidelines

- Be clear and specific
- Analyze why result does not give desire output
- Refine the idea and the prompt
- Repeat

### Iterative Process

- Try something
- Analyze where the result does not give what you want
- Clarify instructions, give more time to think
- Refine prompts with a batch of examples
